# Dragon Quest Hact
This was a project I did in the 2021 timeframe of reversing the network protocol of Dragon Quest Tact.

This game is now defunct, so I am releasing the source.

It's pretty straightforward - using protobuf / grpc for the network, with special signing in the header.

Project does not compile as-is, only releasing for those trying to create a private server since the game servers are now down.
